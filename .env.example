# --- Data File Configuration (Long Format) ---

# The ABSOLUTE path to the CSV file containing the hourly AC export data
# and market spot prices.
#
# REQUIRED CSV FORMAT (Long/Tidy Format):
# 1. Datetime Index/Column: Must contain an hourly datetime column named 'TimestampUTC'.
#    Data is expected to be in UTC timezone (e.g. '2019-03-31 21:00:00+00:00').
# 2. Park Identifier Column: Must contain a column named 'ParkName'. The values in this
#    column must exactly match the park names defined as keys in config.yml
#    (e.g., 'ExampleParkA', 'ExampleParkB').
# 3. Production Column: Must contain a column named 'AC_Export_kWh' for the hourly
#    AC energy export in kilowatt-hours (kWh).
# 4. Price Column: Must contain a column named 'SpotPriceEUR_MWh' for the hourly
#    electricity spot price (EUR/MWh, excluding VAT).
#
# NOTE: The price column ('SpotPriceEUR_MWh') must contain the specific spot price
# relevant to the park and hour in that row. If all parks share the same price zone,
# the value will be duplicated for all parks in the same hour.
